## User Story

As a marketing agency, we want a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that our own site is optimized for search engines.

## Acceptance Criteria

The website must meet the following accessibility standards:

- Semantic HTML elements throughout the source code.
- HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
- Image and icon elements contain accessible `alt` attributes.
- Heading attributes fall in sequential order.
- Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title.
